# ECOSYNC

### Problem Statement:
To design a model that predicts energy consumption in smart cities and provides actionable insights to reduce wastage. This could involve optimizing energy distribution based on usage  patterns and predicting future demand.

As urbanization accelerates and smart cities expand, managing energy consumption has emerged as a critical challenge, with significant implications for sustainability and environmental health.
This project presents a predictive model that analyzes energy consumption patterns in smart cities to offer actionable insights aimed at reducing wastage. By integrating data from households, weather conditions, population demographics, and time-of-day usage, the model forecasts future energy demands and optimizes energy distribution.
It identifies consumption trends, peak usage periods, and anomalies, providing targeted recommendations for energy-saving measures and efficient distribution strategies. This approach not only minimizes energy wastage but also contributes to lowering the carbon footprint in urban areas, supporting the development of sustainable smart cities and advancing global efforts to combat climate change.

### Project Overview:
